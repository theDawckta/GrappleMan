# GrappleMan
Just controls for now :) This readme will be fleshed out better later.  I wonder if there is a forum on this GitHub thingy we can use.
I made it so you stick to the grapple when you pull up to it.  Thought it would be a fun way to move around.

RMB - Right Mouse Button
Space - Jump
"A" "D" - Move right left
"W" - Pull up to grapple

Loops I have in there now
RMB Throw out grapple ->  RMB Throw rope to grapple -> RMB Pull grapple back
RMB Throw out grapple ->  RMB Throw rope to grapple -> W Pull up to grapple
RMB Throw out grapple ->  RMB Throw rope to grapple -> W Pull up to grapple -> RMB in the middle of your climb will pull rope back but you will maintain your momentum.  Bugged right now as to much velocity is transferred.
