# GrappleMan
Just controls for now :) This readme will be fleshed out better later.  I wonder if there is a forum on this GitHub thingy we can use.
I made it so you stick to the grapple when you pull up to it.  Thought it would be a fun way to move around.

RMB - Right Mouse Button

Space - Jump

"A" "D" - Move right left

"W" - Pull up to grapple

"E" - Let out rope

RMB Throw out grapple ->  RMB Throw rope to grapple -> RMB Pull grapple back
